# CMPv2 PKI Integration Repro (Vault)

This came from a case where a customer wanted to validate Vault PKI CMPv2 through an unencrypted proxy. Their use case involved 5G RAN devices, which commonly use CMPv2 for automated certificate enrollment and renewal, and needed to reach Vault through an HTTP proxy rather than directly over HTTPS.

## Goal

1. Vault CMPv2 is configured and issues certificates.
2. CMPv2 IR works both:
   - directly to Vault over HTTPS
   - via proxy HTTP ingress that forwards upstream to Vault HTTPS

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes Vault deployment already running
- Proxy scenario already deployed — see [kubernetes/proxy-tls-behavior/Vault Proxy TLS Behavior Repro.md](../kubernetes/proxy-tls-behavior/Vault%20Proxy%20TLS%20Behavior%20Repro.md)
- OpenSSL 3.x with `openssl cmp` available

## Step 1: Configure CMPv2 on Vault PKI

Create/verify the required components:

- PKI secrets mount enabled at `pki/`
- dedicated cert auth mount at `cmp-cert/`
- CMP role at `pki/roles/cmp-role`
- CMP config at `pki/config/cmp`

Verification commands:

```bash
vault read pki/config/cmp
vault auth list | grep -i cmp
vault read pki/roles/cmp-role
```

Expected output example:

```text
Key                        Value
---                        -----
enabled                    true
default_path_policy        role:cmp-role
authenticators             map[cert:map[accessor:auth_cert_...]]

cmp-cert/    cert     auth_cert_...     n/a    n/a

# Useful role fields from: vault read pki/roles/cmp-role
issuer_ref                 default
key_type                   rsa
key_bits                   2048
key_usage                  [DigitalSignature KeyAgreement KeyEncipherment]
max_ttl                    72h
allow_any_name             true
```

## Step 2: Validate endpoint routing before CMP transaction

Quick reachability check to CMP role path via proxy:

```bash
curl -H "X-Vault-Token: <token>" \
  http://vault-cmp-proxy.vault.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1/pki/roles/cmp-role/cmp
```

Expected:

```text
405
{"errors":["unsupported operation"]}
```

`405` on `GET` is expected because CMP operations are POST-based.

## Step 3: Run real CMP IR request (direct Vault HTTPS)

Example command used in repro:

```bash
openssl cmp -cmd ir -batch \
  -server https://127.0.0.1:18200/v1/pki/roles/cmp-role/cmp \
  -tls_used \
  -tls_trusted test-certs/vault-server-ca.pem \
  -tls_host vault.vault.svc.cluster.local \
  -tls_cert test-certs/cmp-client-cert.pem \
  -tls_key test-certs/cmp-client-key.pem \
  -trusted test-certs/cmp-root-ca.pem \
  -own_trusted test-certs/cmp-root-ca.pem \
  -cert test-certs/cmp-client-cert.pem \
  -key test-certs/cmp-client-key.pem \
  -newkey test-certs/ir-key.pem \
  -subject "/CN=cmp-issued.local" \
  -certout test-certs/ir-direct-cert.pem \
  -rspout test-certs/ir-direct-rsp.der \
  -disable_confirm \
  -verbosity 8
```

Expected success lines:

```text
CMP info: sending IR
CMP info: received IP
received 1 newly enrolled certificate(s)
```

## Step 4: Run real CMP IR request (proxy HTTP -> Vault HTTPS)

Example command used in repro:

```bash
openssl cmp -cmd ir -batch \
  -server http://127.0.0.1:18080/v1/pki/roles/cmp-role/cmp \
  -trusted test-certs/cmp-root-ca.pem \
  -own_trusted test-certs/cmp-root-ca.pem \
  -cert test-certs/cmp-client-cert.pem \
  -key test-certs/cmp-client-key.pem \
  -newkey test-certs/ir-key.pem \
  -subject "/CN=cmp-issued-via-proxy.local" \
  -certout test-certs/ir-proxy-cert.pem \
  -rspout test-certs/ir-proxy-rsp.der \
  -disable_confirm \
  -verbosity 8
```

Expected success lines:

```text
CMP info: sending IR
CMP info: received IP
received 1 newly enrolled certificate(s)
```

## Step 5: Validate issued certs

```bash
openssl x509 -in test-certs/ir-direct-cert.pem -noout -subject -issuer -dates
openssl x509 -in test-certs/ir-proxy-cert.pem -noout -subject -issuer -dates
```

Observed repro output:

```text
subject=CN=cmp-issued.local
issuer=CN=CMP Root CA

subject=CN=cmp-issued-via-proxy.local
issuer=CN=CMP Root CA
```

## Repro conclusion

- Vault CMPv2 IR succeeded directly over HTTPS.
- Vault CMPv2 IR also succeeded through proxy HTTP ingress with HTTPS upstream to Vault.
- This demonstrates technical viability of proxy HTTP -> Vault HTTPS for CMP IR in this lab.
